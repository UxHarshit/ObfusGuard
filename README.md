# ObfusGuard

ObfusGuard is a C++ header file designed to obfuscate code for enhanced security. It prevents static analysis and reverse engineering by manipulating control flow, wrapping functions, and introducing other techniques to obscure the programâ€™s logic.

## Features

- **Control Flow Obfuscation**: Dynamically alters the execution path of the program, making it harder to follow.
- **Inlining Prevention**: Key functions are marked to prevent inlining, preserving their structure and adding complexity.
- **Randomized Operations**: Introduces random calculations to further obscure the program's behavior.
- **Proxy Function Wrapping**: Functions are wrapped in proxies to add extra indirection and confuse reverse engineering tools.

## Usage

1. Include the header file in your C++ project:
   ```cpp
   #include "OBFUSCATE.hpp"
   ```

2. Enable control flow obfuscation by setting `CONTROL_FLOW_BRANCHING` to `1`:
   ```cpp
   #define CONTROL_FLOW_BRANCHING 1
   ```

3. The obfuscation techniques will automatically be applied when using the provided functions and macros.

## Snapshots

Here are some snapshots showing the difference between the source code, unprotected decompiled code, and protected decompiled code:

- **Source Code**: Snapshot of the original source code before obfuscation.

- **Unprotected Decompiled Code**: Snapshot of the code after decompiling an unprotected version.

- **Protected Decompiled Code**: Snapshot of the code after decompiling an obfuscated version.

## Future Goals

- [x] Obfuscate `else` Blocks
- [ ] Obfuscate `for` and `while` Loops
- [ ] Implement Advanced Randomization
- [ ] Add Additional Compiler Directives
